mikeclodfelter,"San Diego, CA","@Santos4Congress And comparing to a pandemic year, when demand was down greatly, is just not a practical comparison. Of course it would’ve been lower then, that’s just basic rules of economics. I’d be more interested in hearing comparisons to 2019. Why do people keep doing this? 🤦🏻‍♂️"
bobpegram,"Campbell, CA",@jmscrimshaw @laurenboebert When he cuts off oil from Canada that reduces supply without reducinty demand. Basic economics shows why this raises prices. Take Econ 101.

That's what the bread price fixing scandal the #Weston family were involved with here in Canada. It doesn't take an economics degree to figure this shit out. 🤷🏾
