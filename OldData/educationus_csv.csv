aNellytics,"Washington, D.C.","@ChrisMoxley19 I love Zach Evans still. Don’t know what there’s not to move as a talent 🤷🏻‍♂️ the off-field commitment issues matter for college but shouldn’t matter in the NFL, right?

And then it’s just a matter of how you value a class. I value it by the high end guys. ‘22 is much deeper though"
BereftOfTheDial,Massachusetts,College football is illegitimate as long as there's not a playoff system open to all 130 FBS teams. 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/Y7EU0tL0WD
Suzushiiro,"New York, NY","@naricat @PowerfulHag I remember this because

A) I was definitely supposed to be paying attention in class in a college lecture hall when reading about it on /a/ for the first time
B) The time slot change made them have to re-write the whole first part of R2 to make it more friendly to newcomers"
Joshua75104,"Cedar Hill, TX",@SportsCenter If we’re talking High School then it’s Kyler but if we’re talking College it’s Vince and Professional it’s Drew Brees!
moran_glenn,cowpens sc,@Benyamin_Ehud @BarrettSallee Rattler Would start  for 90% of the programs in college football today. Bo nix would be a better quarterback than what we have now at South Carolina. Again Johnson would be an upgrade for most programs Brennen I'm not too familiar with.  the kid just went to Texas from Ohio State
JimLongo63,"Marion, OH","When college athletes enter the transfer portal, do they have to empty their pockets and remove their shoes?"
bontz664,"Nebraska, USA","@Husker_Power15 I like college football. Don’t question my fandom. 

I am not worried, JW if anything something happened other than not having as successful as a season they had expected. 

Or if the transfer portal is just getting out of control for no apparent reason."
Chris_Weiner95,"Joliet, Illinois",@SportsTalkRyno It’s not a biased guess lol. It’s an inference based on his college career.

FrankDonoghue1,"Columbus,Ohio ",@mlmcgill Right before I went off to college I read Twain's Roughing It. I did learn from it--don't snore or someone might get annoyed and shoot you in your sleep. That's something I guess.
RobRichOkla,"Oklahoma City, OK","@ryanharvey @mwd40 @PFF_College @CALEBcsw @OU_Football Actually Baker did quite well at Tech under kliff Kingsbury and we all now Murray is probably the best QB to play high school football. Made helluva plays out of nothing. Jalen Hurts started as a true freshman at Alabama. Now did he tweak a lit bit of their game, yes...."

maxwellpower,"California, USA","@ArrogantNBlack I'm not into the whole, ""pay for my college"" rigamarole, but student loans are notoriously restrictive. That's the conversation we should be having instead of this ridiculously selfish nonsense."
kathy_crumley,OK.,"@JThomasYounger @Yahoo Not a real college.. she's probably apprenticing her father's old practice.

TheJoeyMcNeely,United States,Marco Wilson had some of the worst college tape I ever watched from a draft-eligible corner. He was brutal. How some of these coaches and scouts have jobs is far beyond me. Any #Gators fan will concur he was horrendous at UF.
girlscoutbadger,"Georgia, USA","@LouisatheLast @MaraWilson There are masters programs I would LOVE to do bc I’m passionate about it, but I already pay $600/month in private student loans and I’m a teacher; I can’t afford to take on any more college debt unless it’s going to make $$$. But I have 0 interest in the degrees that make $$$ 🙃"
